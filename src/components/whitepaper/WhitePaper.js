                <p>We're taking this to the moon 🚀. There's no risk so let's leave the FUD<b>*</b> at home</p>

                <h2>Ok, ok, ok...</h2>
                <p>This is just for fun. The blockchain is written in Python so is in no way robust or scalable enough to take it all the way to the moon 🚀 ⛔️ 🌕.</p>
                <p>What it does do is give us a playground to make transactions on a blockchain, building up a (hopefully) interesting set of data.</p>
                <p>To make this more interesting the value of the currency will be manipulated in a couple of different ways, meaning there is a likelihood for wins and losses. Don't worry though as the money is fake and you can always refresh your screen to gain a new wallet and balance.</p>
                <p>Once we've done this a couple of times we will take a look at the blockchains.</p>
                <p>I will also share the code with those who are interested in either this super stylish frontend or the boring old blockchain backend.</p>
                <p>Let's go make some 💰💰💰</p>
